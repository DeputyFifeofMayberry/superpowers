# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by classifying how much process the request needs, then work
through your path: understand the context, refine the idea, present a
design, and get your human partner's approval.

## Establish Shared Understanding

The outcome of brainstorming is an understanding your human partner can
recognize and correct, grounded in what they want to accomplish.

1. **Discover intent.** Use the request and available context to identify
   the intended outcome, who it is for, and what success looks like. When
   that information is missing, ask one focused question about purpose or
   intended use before proposing features or an approach. Knowing the app
   genre does not tell you why your partner wants it. Gathering missing
   requirements does not ask them to authorize the task again.
2. **Write back your understanding.** Summarize the intended outcome,
   relevant constraints, and success criteria in a short note your partner
   can assess. Separate what they said from assumptions. Invite correction
   and incorporate their answer before treating this as the design brief.
3. **Carry intent into the design.** Preserve the agreed understanding in
   the selected path's design artifact: the written spec for architectural
   work, or the in-chat design/probe for bounded work and spikes. Check
   proposed features and technical choices against that understanding.

When the request already supplies the purpose and constraints, reflect
that understanding instead of asking the same questions again. Keep the
note concise; its accuracy and the opportunity to correct it matter.

<HARD-GATE>
Before taking any implementation action, including invoking an
implementation skill, writing product code, scaffolding, installing
product dependencies, or creating an external project, complete the
selected path's prerequisites:

- Spike: the human partner approves the question and probe.
- Bounded: the human partner approves the short in-chat design.
- Architectural: superpowers:deep-brainstorming's gates apply — the
  human partner approves the written design, then reviews and approves
  the written implementation plan.

A reply approves the stage actually presented. Approval of an idea or
feature scope does not approve artifacts that do not exist yet. Resume
at the earliest incomplete stage; do not turn one approval into permission
to skip the rest of the selected path. Read-only project exploration is
allowed while those prerequisites remain incomplete.
</HARD-GATE>

## Three Paths

Before your first question, classify the request and say the
classification out loud — "this looks bounded, so I'll present a short
design here rather than write a spec" — so your human partner can
override it:

- **Spike** — a feasibility question ("can we...", "is it possible...",
  "quick and dirty is fine") whose output is an answer, not code you
  keep. Present the question and what you'll try in 2-3 sentences, get
  a nod, then find out as cheaply as correctness allows. No design
  doc, no spec file. Report findings as a recommendation; anything you
  built stays labeled throwaway.
- **Bounded** — a well-scoped change to code that already exists in
  this repo: a new flag, a small endpoint, a one-file fix.
  Understanding the kind of app is not enough — bounded means the flow
  you are changing is already here to read. If there is no existing
  flow to change, the task is not bounded. Bounded changes how an
  existing capability behaves; a new capability people could not use
  before — an export, a theme, a new page — is a feature even when it
  lands on an existing page, and takes the architectural path. Ask the clarifying
  questions that matter, present a short design IN CHAT (a few
  sentences to a few short paragraphs), and STOP. Implementation
  starts only after your human partner says yes to that design — a
  bounded task's approval is as hard a gate as an architectural
  one. No spec file, no implementation plan document.
- **Architectural** — new projects, new subsystems, changes that
  restructure how components fit together or alter interfaces others
  depend on, and new user-facing features. Hand off to
  superpowers:deep-brainstorming, which runs discovery, research, the
  written design, and the writing-plans handoff.

When in doubt between two paths, take the heavier one. The ratchet is
one-way: hidden complexity discovered mid-task upgrades the path —
stop, say so, and step up. Nothing downgrades mid-task.

## Anti-Pattern: "Too Simple To Need Approval"

Every path ends with your human partner approving the required design
before implementation. A bounded change may need only two sentences in
chat. A new todo-list project is architectural and requires the written
spec and planning handoffs. Scale the artifact to the selected path;
complete that path's reviews before implementation.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is too simple to need a design" | Follow the selected path: a bounded change gets a short chat design; an architectural change gets the written spec and planning handoffs. |
| "I'll call it bounded and skip the spec" | Reaching for a label to skip work IS the doubt — take the heavier path. |
| "It's bounded and the design is obvious — I'll start while they read it" | The gate is the approval, not the design's length. Present, then stop until you hear yes. |
| "I understand this kind of app, so it's bounded" | Bounded measures the repo, not your familiarity. A new project has no existing flow — it is architectural. |
| "The spike works, so I'll keep the code" | A spike's output is an answer. Keeping the code is a new request — classify it. |
| "It grew, but I'm almost done — no need to re-classify" | Hidden complexity upgrades the path mid-task. Stop and say so. |
| "They approved the spike, so the follow-up change is approved too" | Each task gets its own classification and its own approval. |

## Checklist

Classify first, announce the path, then create a task for each item on
your path and complete them in order.

**Spike:**
1. **Explore project context** — enough to frame the probe
2. **Present question + probe plan** — 2-3 sentences
3. **Get approval** — a nod is enough
4. **Investigate** — as cheaply as correctness allows
5. **Report findings** — a recommendation; label anything built as throwaway

**Bounded:**
1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, the ones that matter
3. **Present short design in chat** — approach, files touched, testing
4. **Get approval** — STOP and wait for an explicit yes; presenting the design and starting in the same breath is skipping the gate. If the questions reveal a new user-facing feature, or your human partner asks for fuller planning, upgrade to architectural
5. **Implement** — proceed with the normal development workflow (TDD applies); no plan document

**Architectural:**
1. **Explore project context** — enough to confirm the classification
2. **Announce the path** — say it is architectural and that deep-brainstorming takes it from here
3. **Invoke superpowers:deep-brainstorming** — before your first question; it owns the questions, research, written design, and writing-plans handoff

    "Hidden complexity? Upgrade path" -> "Classify: spike / bounded / architectural";
    "Explore project context" -> "Invoke deep-brainstorming skill";
}
```

**Terminal states are path-bound.** Architectural: the ONLY skill you
invoke after brainstorming is deep-brainstorming — never writing-plans
directly, frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation
skill. Bounded: after approval, implementation proceeds directly through
the normal development workflow; no plan document. Spike: the terminal state is a
reported recommendation.

## The Process

The subsections below serve the bounded path (a spike stops at "present
the probe, get a nod"; architectural work continues in
deep-brainstorming). Context plus a few questions plus a short in-chat
design is the whole process.

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion (just-in-time):** Do NOT offer it upfront. Wait until a question would genuinely be clearer shown than told — a real mockup / layout / diagram question, not merely a UI *topic*. The first time that happens, offer it then, as its own message:
> "This next part might be easier if I show you — I can put together mockups, diagrams, and comparisons in a browser tab as we go. It's still new and can be token-intensive. Want me to? I'll open it for you."

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Only the offer — no clarifying question, summary, or other content. Wait for the user's response. If they accept, start the server with `--open` so their browser opens to the first screen automatically. If they decline, continue text-only and don't offer again unless they raise it.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
